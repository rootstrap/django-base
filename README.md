# django-base

  

This project includes the basic boilerplate for a basic rest-api made in django.

  

## Create django project from django-base.

You can follow this steps to create a django project, using this one as a base.

  

1. Clone this repo:

`$ git clone git@github.com:rootstrap/django-base.git` and change the folder name (django-base) to your new project name.

2. Move into the renamed folder and delete the track from git:

`$ sudo rm -r git`

3. Change the main app name (django_base) to your new main app name.

4. Change all ocurrencies of django-base to your project name, and all ocurrencies of django_base to your main app name. You can use for example:

`$ grep iRl "django-base" ./` in the project folder to search all ocurrencies.

5. Generate a unique secret key for your project:

+ `$ python manage.py shell` to open a Django bash.

+ `$ from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key`

+ `$ get_random_secret_key()`. After this command, you get a secret key. Set the value in a virtual environment variable called `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` (this will be used in settings).

6. If you want to corroborate, run:

`$ python manage.py runserver` and check the correct start.

  

If everything went ok, you have now your project created with this one as a base.

You can follow the installation instructions to start working.

  

## Installation instructions.

- Create a virtual environment with:

`$ mkvirtualenv <env_name>`

- Switch to the virtualenv with:

`$ workon <env_name>`

- Install the dependencies:

`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

- Set general configuration in `<main_app_name>/settings/base.py` file. Then split the configuration for each environment you use, in different files under `<main_app_name>/settings/<env_name>.py`. After that, set on each environment you use, the `<env_name>` in a environment variable called `ENV_ROLE`. Default environment name is `development`.

- Run the initial migrations:

`$ python manage.py migrate`

- To add apps to the project you have to run:

`$ python manage.py startapp <appname>`

- Edit the models.py as desired, and add the urls to api/urls.py

  

## Deploy to Heroku.

Rename the desired procfile from one of the examples.

Gunicorn is the standard for simple web apps wich rely on wsgi only.

If you need to use websockets and channels you'll need to use daphne to suport both asgi and wsgi.

  

## Running on docker

  

Install Docker official mac app https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac .

Start Docker, login on docker (with `docker login`) and run the following commands:

1. `$ docker-compose build` to create the image.

2. `$ docker-compose run web python manage.py migrate` to run migrations.

3. `$ docker-compose run web` to start the backend on port 8000 (you can change this in the docker-compose.yml).
